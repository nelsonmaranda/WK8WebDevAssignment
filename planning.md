### 2) Pages (Multipage Structure)
1) **Home**: Hero value proposition, quick overview of services, impact highlights, and clear calls to action.
2) **About**: Company story, mission/vision in Kenya, team snapshot, certifications/partners.
3) **Services**: Detailed services (household collection, commercial waste, recycling programs, e-waste, pickups), service areas, simple pricing guidance.
4) **Resources**: Educational hub with sorting guides, FAQs, and downloadable tips for Kenyan contexts.
